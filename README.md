# 2048-Game
The following project show the 2048 game demonstration.

- The 2048 Game is completed written in Python3 language.
- It has only **Game2048.py** executable file and complete program was written in the same file. 
- After making a particular move in the game, the resulatant output is printed in the form of a grid with updated values in them.

# Discussion Objectives

## 1.Design Principles Used

The basic design principle used here is the algorithm. By analyzing the algorithm and working principle we come to a conclusion that we need to traverse each and every grid postion in the gird and make our operation for making the game very successful.

## 2.Thoughts

While thinking about writing the algorithm I thought of writing it all in a single file and divide all the process into seperate function. So my code consists of many functions where each and every function does an operation and plays an important role for processing the output.
- The complete code is broken into functions which are called at each stage.

## 3.Probable Solution

The probable solution is we need to check each and every grid for finding an oppurtunity to continue the game. By dividing the solution into different segments called functions the process became easy than expected.

## 4.Problems faced while designing the solution

- One of the problem was the syntax errors like varibles missing and identation errors.
- Some times after dividing the solution into functions, I got some confusion of connecting the functions by function calls. It happened many times, so I used to workout the connections on paper and then proceed with the solution.

## 5.Code walkthrough

The complete code walkthough is done in **Game2048.py** file where I have explained the functionality and usage of every function by writing the comments on top of that particular function. Please do watch that approach of mine as I thought it will be easier if we have the Code walkthrough through the code.

## 6.Scope of making this an 8x8 from 4x4

This step have been implemenented very good. We just need to change the **size of the grid** and that variable is present in my code at the starting lines.The variable used in code is **size**. Changing that variable value changes it into our wanted size.

## 7.Changing from 2048 to 4096 as end number

I have initialized a variable **total** in the code , so we can change it to our wanted size in the code and can play the game :) ..
